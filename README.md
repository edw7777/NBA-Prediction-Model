# NBA-Prediction-Model

Hi, Welcome to my NBA Predicition Model. This project was aimed at predicting the outcomes of NBA games using Machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that takes in various features, including team statistics, and predicts the final score of a game. This README provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for running and extending the codebase.
